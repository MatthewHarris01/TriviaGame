# TriviaGame
play a timed trivia game with the computer.
Version 1.0 -- all code completed and working.
Version 0.1 -- file placeholders created
Version 0.2 -- favicon file added.
Version 0.3 -- app.js file added. .css file partially populated. Images added.
Version 0.4 -- code started. Question object prototyped and tested, object constructor not yet implemented. All images have been resize and place in the assets/images folder. Currently working on code to ensure that the randomly generated ID number for each question does not get re-used.
Version 0.5 -- Question object constructor completed, cod to build Question object list completed.
Version 0.6 -- methodology to randomize order in which possible answers are displayed, and the order in which Questions are displayed has been coded and tested.
Version 0.6 -- index2.html prototypes how questions and answers should be diplayed. index3.html prototypes how answers should be displayed. Both prototypes are complet. Styles for question and answer elements are in the style.css file. A generic image has been added for questions which to not have a specific associated image.
Version 0.7 -- back to spinning my wheels on the unique random number array code. i keep getting infinite loops, and I really can't seem to find why. I'm going to revert back to the last working version, and see if I can get thing straghtend out tomorrow. neutral image for questions that don't have an image has been created as "blank.jpg"
Version 0.8 -- after alost 12 hours of trying to make the randomization of questions and answers work without success, I have given up on that feature. As of 0.8, question display and answer selection works, and answer display works. A neutral placeholder image has been created for questions whose answers do not have an associated image.
Version 0.9 -- index4.html is a prototype of the score display, and will be removed from final project files.
ADDED sound files in assets/sounds, for win/lose sounds; sounds play correctly!
Version 0.91 -- had trouble adding a div inside the game-play area, and to avoid spinning my wheels for an excessive amount of time, decided to just display the score information in the game-play area, and display the score information with the same technique used to display questions and answers. NOTE that the prototype files, index2.html, index3.html, index4.html, and the testing document "random numbers2.html" have all been removed from the project files.
Version 0.92 -- everything is complete, but have some bugs that appear after showing the final score. After trying to resolve those bugs, other stuff broke, and now the game does not move on from showing the answer to the initial question. I hate turning work in late, but geven that is it afte 2 am, I just seem to be spinning my wheels on this for now. I will have to see if I can get things wrapped up tomorrow, and jsut bite the bullet and turn the project in late, I don't really see what else to do for now.
Version 1.0 -- all code, including and especially the Score dipslay, completed and working!

KNOWN ISSUES: none as of Version 1.0.
SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS: 1) keep separate scores for each round of play, game currently keeps score values aggregated over all rounds of play. 2) devise a methdology to randomize the order in which questions are displayed, withou repeating any question. Also deveise a methodoloty to randomize the order in which answer choices are displayed, so that the correct answer does not appear in the same location in the list of answers.
